# scrape-projects-from-sourceforge.net
Python code implementing the Beautiful soup library to scrape project names from sourceforge.net.
SourceForge is a web-based service that offers software developers a centralized online location to control and manage free and open-source
software projects. It provides a source code repository, bug tracking, mirroring of downloads for load balancing, a wiki for documentation,
developer and user mailing lists, user-support forums, user-written reviews and ratings, a news bulletin, micro-blog for publishing project
updates, and other features
This code scrapes throgh the directory of sourceforge.net to get project names by first extracting their links using beautiful soup.
